Small wplace utilities collection, which includes:

* Go to WPlace and open the Stylus menu and press "Create new style for" option
* Paste everything and press Save

  * If you would like to adjust the colors of the canvas, I would recommend checking out [Map Dark](https://github.com/autergame/WplacePlugins/tree/main).
